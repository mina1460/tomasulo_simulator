- December 6, 9:00PM:
    - decided on the project design and data flow
    - designed the classes (Tomasulu, instruction, reservation station)

- December 7, 7:00PM: 
    - wrote the assembly parser that extracts the operands and fill them in the instruction class 
    - started writing the issue instruction
    - thought that we are going to need register renaming and we wrote its function, but it turned out that it is not needed.
    - we removed it afterwards

- December 8, 10:00PM:
    - wrote the issue and execute functions 
    - found out that we need a new class for register status and we wrote it

- December 9, 2:00PM:
    - wrote the write back function and the driver loop and tested LW, SW, ADDI, ADD, NEG, DIV, JALR
    - fixed errors in dependencies 
    - it's now 2:15 AM xD, we will continue tomorrow. 

- December 10, 1:00Pm: 
    - made sure execution can start in the same cycle as the write back if data was forwarded
    - fixed a lot of errors 
    - Wrote the remaining testing programs and validated that everything is working fine
    - Success! ready to submit (6:45PM)
