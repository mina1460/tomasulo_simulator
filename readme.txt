Version: Final Tomasulu Simulator

Note: even though the program compiles succesfully on all platforms, we have faced problems we tried running it on windows; however, it runs flawlessly on all virtual machines and macbooks.
we tested it on Mint (VM and native OS), Ubuntu (VM only), and on a macbook and it is working fine.

		Please run your tests on any of them.
